## Stoga Hub
Stoga Hub is the quintessential website for Pioneers at Conestoga High School. We designed StogaHub with the student in mind, and the constant issues a Pioneer faces at Conestoga, with a centralization of crucial information. StogaHub acts as the centralisation hub for high school students - welcome to the future, stoga.
